"0","#| fig-cap: A scatterplot showing the concentration of growth factor against gene expression, coloured by treatment, with size representing the cell line. The lines represent quantiles, where $25\%, 50\%$ and $75\%$ of values lie below the lines, respectively. We find that on average, as the concentration of growth factor increases, gene expression also increases. Gene lines treated with Activating Factor 42 appear to have greater gene expression for all concentrations, meanwhile there does not appear to be a strong relationship between the cell line and gene expression."
