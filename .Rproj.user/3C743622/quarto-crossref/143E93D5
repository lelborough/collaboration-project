The lines represent quantiles, where 25\\%, 50\\% and 75\\% of values lie below the lines, respectively. We find that on average, as the concentration of growth factor increases, gene expression also increases. Gene lines treated with Activating Factor 42 appear to have greater gene expression for all concentrations, meanwhile there does not appear to be a strong relationship between the cell line and gene expression."},{"key":"fig-1","order":{"section":[4,0,0,0,0,0,0],"number":1},"caption":"Histogram showing the number of each gene expression value observed.
