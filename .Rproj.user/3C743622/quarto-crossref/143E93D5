The lines represent quantiles, where 25\\%, 50\\% and 75\\% of values lie below the lines, respectively. We find that on average, as the concentration of growth factor increases, gene expression also increases. Gene lines treated with Activating Factor 42 appear to have greater gene expression for all concentrations, meanwhile there does not appear to be a strong relationship between the cell line and gene expression.","key":"fig-6","order":{"number":6,"section":[4,0,0,0,0,0,0]}},{"caption":"A scatterplot showing the concentration of growth factor against gene expression, coloured by treatment. As concentration increases, gene expression also increases linearly, with a steeper increase for Activating Factor 42 per unit concentration (mg/ml) compared with the placebo trials. On average, there is greater gene expression for the Activating Factor 42 treatment than the placebo.","key":"fig-3","order":{"number":3,"section":[4,0,0,0,0,0,0]}},{"caption":"A boxplot showing the spread of gene expression for each gene line, coloured by treatment type.
